    <!-- The provided HTML code is creating a section with multiple color boxes inside a main element.
    Each color box is represented by a section element with a class of "color-box" and a unique id
    corresponding to a color (red, blue, green, white, yellow). The main element has a class of
    "boxes" which likely groups these color boxes together for styling or functionality purposes.
    The purpose of this structure seems to be creating a user interface where clicking on these
    color boxes will change the background color of the page. -->

        <section class="color-box" id="red"></section>
        <section class="color-box" id="blue"></section>
